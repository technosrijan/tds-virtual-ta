## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.

For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:

- Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
- Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
- Styling data visualizations and web applications
- Debugging website issues using browser DevTools

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides detailed documentation on the three main types of selectors:

- Basic CSS selectors: Learn about element (`div`), class (`.container`), ID (`#header`), and universal (`*`) selectors
- Attribute selectors: Target elements based on their attributes or attribute values (`[type="text"]`)
- Combinators: Use relationships between elements (`div > p`, `div + p`, `div ~ p`)
