## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

[](https://youtu.be/zxEtfHseE84)

This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:

- **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis.
- **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs.
- **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation.
- **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system's clustering accuracy.
- **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
