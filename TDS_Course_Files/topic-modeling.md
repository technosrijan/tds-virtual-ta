## Topic Modeling

[](https://youtu.be/eQUNhq91DlI)

You'll learn to use text embeddings to find text similarity and use that to create topics automatically from text, covering:

- **Embeddings**: How large language models convert text into numerical representations.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Understanding how similar embeddings indicate similar meanings.
- **Embedding Visualization**: Using tools like Tensorflow Projector to visualize embedding spaces.
- **Embedding Applications**: Using embeddings for tasks like classification and clustering.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Using OpenAI's API to generate embeddings for text.
- **Model Comparison**: Exploring different embedding models and their strengths and weaknesses.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculating cosine similarity between embeddings for more reliable similarity measures.
- **Embedding Cost**: Understanding the cost of generating embeddings using OpenAI's API.
- **Embedding Range**: Understanding the range of values in embeddings and their significance.
